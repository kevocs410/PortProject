# PortProject
Porfolio Project 


 technologies used, the approach taken, a link to your live site, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
 
When making this protfolio, I first had a thought of making it 2 pages. Then I decided that I could make everything simple and thats how I got to 
what I created. 

I do have a few problems mostly with some content being out of place, like with words not being leveled. I also tried to make it functional 
on mobile. Worked really well with flex box but again the words made it a little hard so I improvised on a few things.

I feel as though the portfolio is good but  with more studying I can make it wayyyy better.
